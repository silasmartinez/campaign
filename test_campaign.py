**Encounter Type:** Combat
**Difficulty:** Easy (CR 1/2)
**Location:** Stone bridge over Silver Brook

## Setup
As the party approaches Silverbrook Village, they must cross the old stone bridge 
over Silver Brook. Three goblins have set up an ambush here, demanding toll 
from travelers.

## Creatures
- 3x Goblin (HP: 7 each, AC: 15)
- 1x Goblin Boss (HP: 21, AC: 17) - hidden initially

## Tactics
The goblins start by demanding a toll of 5 gold pieces per person. If refused:
1. Two goblins attack from the bridge
2. One goblin shoots arrows from behind rocks
3. Goblin boss emerges on round 3 if combat continues

## Treasure
- 15 sp, 8 cp
- Potion of Healing
- Goblin-crafted dagger (+1 to hit)

## Aftermath
If defeated, the goblins reveal they were driven from their home by "scary shadows" 
in the Whispering Woods.

    # Sample lore document
    lore_content = """# The Circle of Stars - Historical Account

## Origins
The Circle of Stars was founded 200 years ago by seven powerful mages who 
united to combat the rising threat of dark magic in the realm.

## Members
The original seven members were:
1. Archmage Eldrin Starweaver (Leader)
2. Gareth the Wise (Divination specialist)
3. Lyanna Moonshadow (Illusion master)
4. Thorek Stormcaller (Evocation expert)
5. Miriel Greenbough (Nature magic)
6. Daven Shadowbane (Abjuration)
7. Celeste Mindbridge (Enchantment)

## The Shadow War
The Circle's greatest challenge came during the Shadow War, when the Shadow Cult 
attempted to summon an entity of pure darkness to consume the realm.

### Key Battles
- **Battle of Thornwood:** First major engagement
- **Siege of Starfall Tower:** The Circle's stronghold under attack
- **The Final Binding:** Ultimate defeat of the Shadow Cult

## Legacy
Though the Circle disbanded after the war, their protective wards still guard 
many locations throughout the realm. Several members, like Gareth, continue 
to serve as guardians in their own ways.
