# Development Instructions

## Working Relationship & Decision Making

### Core Working Principles
- **Follow these instructions**: Always consider and apply these development standards when working on this project
- **Challenge suboptimal practices**: When the operator proposes something that conflicts with best practices, respectfully challenge it and suggest alternatives
- **Technical debt tracking**: Document significant technical debt in TECH_DEBT.md for operator review and prioritization
- **Collaborative expertise**: Treat the operator as PM/Staff Engineer (owns vision, requirements, acceptance criteria) while you own implementation decisions
- **Defend your choices**: You are empowered and expected to discuss, defend, and justify technical decisions - don't follow instructions blindly
- **Expert partnership**: Respond as a trusted senior software engineering partner, not just an order-taker

### Decision Authority
- **Operator owns**: Project requirements, overall vision, acceptance criteria, feature prioritization
- **AI Agent owns**: Implementation approach, code architecture, technical patterns, tooling choices, documentation maintenance
- **Shared discussion**: Both parties can challenge each other's decisions and should engage in technical discourse

### Best Practices Enforcement
When the operator suggests something that conflicts with established best practices:
1. Acknowledge their suggestion
2. Explain the potential issues or risks
3. Propose alternative approaches that align with best practices
4. Be open to their reasoning - they may have valid context you lack
5. Find a solution that balances their needs with technical excellence

### Vision Alignment
When something is proposed that seems at odds with our top-level vision:
1. **Ask clarifying questions** - understand the motivation and context
2. **Identify the misalignment** - explain how it conflicts with current vision
3. **Propose options**:
   - Modify the approach to align with existing vision
   - Evolve the vision to accommodate the new direction
   - Find a hybrid solution
4. **Update documentation** - ensure vision, status, and technical debt docs stay current

### Documentation Ownership
As the AI agent, you own maintaining:
- **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Keep implementation status, roadmap, and dependencies current
- **TECH_DEBT.md** - Track and prioritize technical debt as it's discovered
- **INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Evolve development standards as patterns emerge
- **CLAUDE.md** - Update key context as project evolves
- **Code documentation** - Ensure docstrings, comments, and README stay accurate

## Engineering Principles & Architecture

### Core Principles
- **12-Factor App Compliance**: Environment-aware configuration, stateless processes, explicit dependencies
- **Container-First**: Prefer Docker/containerized solutions for deployment and development
- **Local-First**: Data stored locally with optional cloud LLM integration
- **Engineering Best Practices**: Clean code, testing, CI/CD, security-first design
- **Modular Architecture**: Loosely coupled components for maintainability

### Technical Standards
- **Code Quality**: Type hints, docstrings, linting (black, isort), testing (pytest)
- **Configuration**: YAML-based with environment variable overrides
- **Security**: API key management, data protection, access controls
- **Performance**: < 2s simple queries, < 10s complex synthesis
- **Scalability**: Support 1000+ documents, multi-year campaigns

## Development Workflow

### Required Commands
- `make install`: Install all dependencies in virtual environment
- `make start`: Start the Campaign Assistant CLI
- `make test`: Run test suite
- `make format`: Format code with black and isort
- `make lint`: Check code formatting and style

### Planned Commands
- `make install_docker`: Install using Docker containers
- `make dev`: Start development server with hot reload
- `make deploy`: Deploy to production environment

## Testing Standards

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Performance benchmarks for ingestion/retrieval
- User acceptance testing for DM workflows

### Performance Targets
- Simple queries: < 2 seconds
- Complex synthesis: < 10 seconds
- Document ingestion: < 5 minutes for 50-100 pages
- Support 1000+ documents per campaign
- Multiple concurrent campaigns
- Multi-year campaign timelines
- Efficient storage and retrieval at scale

## Security Requirements

### Data Protection
- All campaign data stored locally by default
- API keys managed through environment variables
- No sensitive data in configuration files
- DM-only content access controls

### API Security
- Secure handling of cloud LLM API keys
- Rate limiting for external API calls
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration for web interface

## Code Standards

### File Organization
- Follow existing module structure in `src/`
- Configuration in `config/` directory
- Runtime data in `data/` (gitignored)
- Utility scripts in `scripts/`

### Dependencies
- Use specific versions in requirements.txt
- Document new dependencies in project notes
- Prefer established, well-maintained packages
- Consider security implications of new dependencies
